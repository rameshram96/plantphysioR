Description: Functions tailored for scientific and student communities involved in plant science research. Functionalities encompass estimation chlorophyll content according to Arnon (1949) <10.1104/pp.24.1.1>, determination water potential of Polyethylene glycol(PEG)6000 as in Michel and Kaufmann (1973) <10.1104/pp.51.5.914>  and functions related to estimation of yield related indices like Abiotic tolerance index as given by Moosavi et al.(2008)<10.22059/JDESERT.2008.27115>, Geometric mean productivity (GMP) by Fernandez (1992) <10.5555/19951607124>, Golden Mean by Moradi et al.(2012)<10.14207/ejsd.2012.v1n3p543>, HAM by Schneider et al.(1997)<10.2135/cropsci1997.0011183X003700010007x>,MPI and TOL by Hossain etal., (1990)<10.2135/cropsci1990.0011183X003000030030x>, RDI by Fischer et al. (1979)<10.1071/AR9791001>,SSI by Fisher et al.(1978)<10.1071/AR9780897>, STI by Fernandez (1993)<10.22001/wvc.72511>,YSI by Bouslama & Schapaugh (1984)<10.2135/cropsci1984.0011183X002400050026x>, Yield index by Gavuzzi et al.(1997)<10.4141/P96-130>.
